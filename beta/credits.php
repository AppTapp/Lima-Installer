        <h3>The code ninja</h3><i>99% of the code of the current version of Lima was written by <a href="http://codedit.me">Codedit</a>, he also is responsible for the idea of Lima.</i>
        <h3>The server monkeys</h3><i>All the server infrastructure used by Lima was provided at amazingly low costs by <a href="http://fliphost.net">Fliphost</a>.</i>
        <h3>The looks</h3><i>The UI framework for the current version of Lima is provided by <a href="http://jquerymobile.com">JqueryMobile</a></i>
        <h3>The hard part of testing</h3><i>Most of the Lima alpha and beta testing was done by <a href="http://twitter.com/awmusic12635">Awmusic12635</a>, he was a great help during the development stages. He also had a lot of good suggestions to make Lima even better and helped getting this beta launched.</i></br>

        <i>During the initial stages of development <a href="http://twitter.com/samguichelaar">Sam</a> helped out in multiple ways getting the project started and promoted, possibly it wouldn't have existed without him.
            Another thank you goes out to <a href="http://koenhendriks.com/">Koen Hendriks</a> for helping and supporting the development of the first version of Lima. The repo owners <a href="http://thebigboss.org">Bigboss</a>, <a href="http://modmyi.com">ModMyi</a> and <a href="http://saurik.com/">Saurik</a> work hard to keep the APT repos containing all the software you can install with Lima online. Last but not least we must say thanks to the iPhone Dev team, the Chronic Dev team and all the other amazing people developing Jailbreaks for our iOS devices.</i>
