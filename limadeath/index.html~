<h1>The end..</h1><hr>
<h3>A summary</h3>
<b>We have decided to retire the Lima project as of today for the following reasons:</b>
<ul>
<li>The costs: Lima already had a large amount of signsups for the beta testing program, if it would go public the amount of users would even become bigger. As Lima gets more users to server costs go up, to cover those server costs Lima would have to start displaying allot of ads all over the website which would ruin the user experience.</li>
<li>The development: Finding reliable developers to work on the Lima project has proven to be a hard task, due to a lack of developers the project has made little progress over the past two years</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>The full story</h3>
<p>We started Lima over 2 years ago as a cool new concept, easy quick app installations from the web browser. Since then it has grown out to a functional browser based centralised APT front end for jailbroken iOS devices. From the beginning there has been allot of interest for the Lima project as it seemed to work much faster and easier than the existing alternative named Cydia. The special thing about Lima was that the indexing of packages happened at a central location rather than on your device itself.
</p>
<p>Lima was developed by students with busy schedules, that was noticable during the past 2 years. You would hear allot about Lima for a week and then you wouldn't hear anything for a few months; Lima's first flaw. There were a multiple parties interested in helping with the development of Lima, but in the end their main goals were either, stealing Lima's source code, making Lima a commercial money making monster or getting early beta access. Luckily none of these parties ever got a chance to "help with the development". 
</p>
<p>So now 2 years later, it's time to remind ourselves that Lima started as an experiment and that it is time for it to end.</p>

<h4>Common misconceptions</h4>
There are a couple misconceptions about Lima which I would like to straighten out. So here are the facts:
<ul>
<li><b>Lima is NOT a jailbreak and also never was a jailbreak. From the beginning on Lima has required a jailbroken device to work.</li>
<li><b>Not everyone who registered for a beta invite got one, but at least 10.000 people did get one. We did send out a significant amount of beta testing invites in our opinion.</li>
<li>We are not going to make a complete list of all of them, but feel free to submit your own misconceptions to us to be added here.</li>
</ul>

                      The simple fact is: it will get stolen. In the past 2 years I've already seen 10 different parties attempting to clone Lima. (iDebstore, iEverythingStore, iOnlineStore, fr0zeninstaller,etc, I am sorry if I forgot to give your fabulous Lima rip off attention in this post) We are not waiting for 10 other people to try the same thing. If people start using the source code to make their own installer they might try to circumvent Lima's complicated security features putting their users at risk. Another reason is that Lima's code isn't exactly "plug-and-play" code. It needs quite a bit of set up to get it working properly.

                      The possibilities are endless. There were plans for things like "Install with Lima" buttons which Jailbreak websites could add on their tweak review pages. Also Lima accounts would've been a big thing. Including automated backups, personalised repositories and the ability to disable certain categories in Lima. Rating and comments on packages were on the ideas list too. Suggestions on what to install based on your installation history, just like what the App Store has. OTA installations, using your desktop browser to push a few packages to your phone. OTA general package management, remove that one package which is causing a repsring loop using your desktop browser. Lima store/Cydia Store integration. All of this of course can not be done when there are not enough developers to work on it.

                      Yes, all support emails will still be answered. Except for the emails asking for beta testing invites. If you wrote your email in arabic, swahili, spanish, capslock or other exotic languages, I am afraid I will also have to disappoint you. Same applies to all the empty "sent from my iphone" emails.

<h4>Thanks</h4>
<p>We would like to thank the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the Lima beta testers for doing an awesome job testing Lima</li>
<li>All the people that showed their interest in Lima, motivating us to work on it</li>
<li>All the blogs that reviewed Lima</li>
<li>Our main webhosting partner <a href="http://fliphost.net/">FlipHost</a> for providing Lima's server power. Send them some cookies! (or buy webhosting from them)</li>
<li>All the real iPhone hackers who made the jailbreaks required for Lima to work. (So NOT the kids who have "iPhone hacker" or "security researcher" in their twitter bio)
<li>The APT package repositories (BigBoss, ModMyi and Saurik) for hosting thousands of packages while not attempting to block Lima.</li>
<li>Anyone else who we forgot to mention here.</li>
</ul>
<br>
So that was it, don't be sad, more awesomeness is likely to come in the future. (We will skip the beta testing and show-off period).
